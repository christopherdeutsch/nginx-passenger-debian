Description: Debugging symbols for nginx
 Nginx (engine x) is a web server created by Igor Sysoev and kindly provided to
 the open-source community. This server can be used as standalone HTTP server
 and as a reverse proxy server before some Apache or another big server to
 reduce load to backend servers by many concurrent HTTP-sessions.
 .
 This package provides debugging symbols for nginx, to assist in debugging
 issues that you may find.  It should not be required for normal operation.
