Description: small, but very powerful and efficient web server and mail proxy
 Nginx (engine x) is a web server created by Igor Sysoev and kindly provided to
 the open-source community. This server can be used as standalone HTTP server
 and as a reverse proxy server before some Apache or another big server to
 reduce load to backend servers by many concurrent HTTP-sessions.
 .
 It can also act as a POP3/IMAP mail proxy with SSL and TLS SNI support.
